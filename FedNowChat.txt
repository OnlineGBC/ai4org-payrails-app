Is there a way for businesses to transfer funds using a zero cost infrastructure similar to India's UPI?
I am trying to build an app, not use this as an end-user.  

Explain this in more detail:  The UPI architecture is open/“agnostic” and supports multiple third-party apps (wallets, bank apps, fintechs), which helps broad interoperability across banks and providers
Can i use Blackrock or other large US company's stablecoin account to build a zero-cost API around that?
What would be the full cost to build a very low cost, UPI-like fintech layer in the US?
Is it possible to compare this against other services like Visa, MasterCard, paypal or Stripe?  It does not need need to be zero cost or low cost.  It just needs to offer that B2B funds transfer
For each of the above scenarios, calculate a break-even cost per transaction assuming 50,000 B2B customers, doing 10 million transactions per year.  Assume for now that all transactions are US or USD-based
What would it take to create a FedNow app for B2B payments?  Check all your data above and also your own research
Are you planning to build a standalone app with direct access to FedNow, or will you be using a partner bank or service provider to access the FedNow network?  <<I would prefer direct access but also would want to consider the cost of outsourcing to a partner bank--whichever costs less in the long run for a traget usage of 10 million transactions a year>>
Do you want the app to support both sending and receiving payments?  <<Yes>>
What kind of businesses will be using this app (e.g., SMBs, enterprises, marketplaces)?  <<All, with an initial focus on SMBs>>
Do you need to handle compliance (KYC/KYB, AML) internally, or will that be outsourced? <<Outsource>>
Do you plan to operate as a regulated entity (e.g., with your own money transmitter licenses), or partner with a regulated institution to avoid that overhead?  <<partner with a regulated institution>>
Can you suggest some banks that offer great service and low cost, like community banks in minority-serving neighborhoods?
on a separate note, what is the end to end cost of using a debit card with Visa or Mastercard?  Is it the same as a credit card?
So to summarize on the FedNow payments app, what we need to do is:
Create a FedNow-enabled B2B payments app will require close collaboration with a banking partner, careful planning around compliance outsourcing, and building a scalable tech stack for instant payments.  The potential banking partners which are already on fedNow are:  Sunrise Banks, Cross River Bank, Carver Federal Savings Bank, M&F Bank, Sutton Bank, OneUnited.

Would you agree?
Can you create a Sierra t=style pitch deck exploring the above for VC funding?
Reduce the above to 2000 characters and no more
Under the current credot/debit card system, how long does it take for the merchant to see the money in their account?
So if there are banks like Cross River that already offer the API and infrastructure, what value add would another entrant offer?
In the last answer above, when you use terms like vendor and provider, is that synonymous with merchant?
Update the Pitch Deck content that you provided which is shown below:

**FedNow B2B Payments Platform: VC Pitch Summary**

**Vision:** Real-time B2B payments for every business. We eliminate delays and reduce costs by leveraging FedNow for instant liquidity.

**Problem:** $100B+ in U.S. B2B payments use outdated rails (ACH, checks, credit cards). SMBs face cash flow delays and high fees (2–3%). Legacy systems lack 24/7 capabilities.

**Solution:** A platform natively integrated with FedNow:

* 24/7 instant credit transfers
* Real-time invoicing via Request-for-Payment (RFP)
* Embedded ledger, permissions, audit
* Compliance outsourced via bank partner

**Product:**

* Intuitive dashboard for SMBs
* API for enterprise/marketplaces
* Real-time balance, notifications, reconciliation

**Why Now:**

* FedNow is live nationwide
* SMBs need faster capital cycles
* FedNow supports up to $10M/txn, enabling large B2B flows

**Business Model:**

* SaaS: Monthly per active account
* Transaction markup: $0.01–$0.05
* Premium APIs, ERP/batch payments

**Advantages:**

* Partnered with FedNow banks:

  * Sunrise, Cross River, Carver, M&F, Sutton, OneUnited
* No MTLs; compliance outsourced
* Faster GTM via sponsor rails

**Market:**

* $27T U.S. B2B payments
* Initial wedge: 5M SMBs
* TAM: $200B+ addressable volume by 2027

**Team:**

* [You], ex-[Fintech]
* [COO], ex-[Compliance]
* Advisors from FedNow/banking ecosystem

**Fundraising:**

* Raise $X to integrate sponsor bank, launch MVP, and scale to 10M txns/year
* Target: $Y ARR in 24 months, 100K+ business clients

**Closing:** FedNow is the pipe. We’re the platform. Join us in building the future of real-time business payments.

Add Slide deck info for the following only:
Healthcare specific HIPAA-compliant ledger tagging, provider remittance
Smart Routing (FedNow, with RTP, ACH and Card fallback)
Single App for multiple sponsor banks

Presentation
Attached is the currrent presentation.  Can you add missing information like the following to the presentation?
Market:
$27T U.S. B2B payments
Initial wedge: 5M SMBs
TAM: $200B+ addressable volume by 2027
Fundraising:
Raise $X to integrate sponsor bank, launch MVP, and scale to 10M txns/year
Target: $Y ARR in 24 months, 100K+ business clients

Put in reasonable values for X and Y
on a related note, do FedNow and RTP have connectivity for payment through mobile phones, and specifically with QRCode or NFC?
Yes please do all four.  Do not reference UPI in any way
Provide the visual slides
ok so this model is obviously great for the conumer and for merchants but absent a government mandate, how does this help a bank or any entity providing these services
Can you create a table comparing the competitive options  RTP, FedNow, ACH, Debit and a platform app?
Convert this into a single comparison slide and Excel table
Write me some bullets about the Product and the Development Roadmap
Compress into one slide
Map the roadmap to funding tranches
Can you create a business model with one bullet each for the following:
Revenue model

Pricing
Average account size and/or lifetime value Sales & distribution model Customer/pipeline list
Check these web sites and call out if you see specific FedNow or RTP partnership references.  If none, say so:
https://www.crossriver.com/, https://sunrisebanks.com/, https://www.carverbank.com/, https://www.mfbonline.com/,  suttonbank.com, https://www.piermontbank.com/, https://banksouthern.com/, https://www.libertybank.net/, https://www.centralbankkc.com/, https://www.oneunited.com/, https://www.lead.bank/
Yes compile whether these banks appear on official FedNow and RTP participant datasets (with routing numbers) and extract links to partner program documentation
explain the role of intermediary service providers (e.g., technology partners)
how do we become an authorized Intermediary Service Provider? 
Assume that i have a depository institution as a partner. Help me code an application that will do whatever is needed on the backend as well as a user-friendly QR-Scan and NFC based app on the front end
A and C--we will use the bank's own FedNow API but we dont have the API documentation yet.  please provide a generic template that we can adapt.  Use Python w FastAPI for the backend.  Use Flutter on the front-end.  Ask me questions as needed.  The end result should be an app that i can insttall on an Android emulator and Android phone

I need a clarification:  When a user signs up, the bank should populate their account balance from the back end right?  Are ypu asking this question for demo purposes since we do not have the API?
Can you ask all the questions in one shot or do you have to ask them one at a time?

The answer is B.  I have a question for you:  why do you keep saying you have "one last question" and then ask 10 more??  This is getting annoyiing
i dont care

ready for Part 2
dont care--just produce 
ready for part 3
give all files as zip

A.  And stop asking more questions.
24H
ok i have the zipfile.  Give me the detailed end-to-end steps to run it, starting with the correct place to extract the ZIP file, if applicable
Looks like something is missing with this setof commands:
from app.database import Base, engine
Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
exit()


I made it one line and have shown you the environment.  Can you fix this error?  I want brief explanations and detailed fixes.  If you dont knowsomething, ask.

adb.exe            pid: 23640  type: File            98: C:\Users\raja\OneDrive\Desktop\DesktopDownloads\flutter
This is what i get in VS Code as an Flutter extension (attached).  
i still get this:


PS C:\Users\raja> flutter --version

There is something wrong.  Why is flutter being installed to OneDrive?  It should either be inside VS Code (preferred) or inside c:\users\raja\ai4org_payrails\ but not in OneDrive


1. You **downloaded the Flutter ZIP** into a folder that is: makefile Copy code `C:\Users\raja\OneDrive\Desktop\DesktopDownloads\` 2. On many Windows systems: * **Desktop** * **Documents** * **Downloads** are **OneDrive-synced folders by default** 3. You extracted Flutter **there** 4. VS Code Flutter extension then **found that SDK path** and started using it So: * ❌ Flutter was **not installed by VS Code** * ❌ Flutter was **not intentionally installed to OneDrive** * ✅ Flutter is just sitting wherever the ZIP was extracted * ✅ VS Code is pointing to that path This is why you are seeing file locks, PATH confusion, and adb issues.

this is wrong.  I just installed flutter in VS Code.  Dont blame me falsely.  i find it offensive.  Just check the settings that would have put it in the wrong place and fix it
i think the first thing is to install fultter on the PowerSheel frontend , probably in the mobile_flutter directory?  I am not sure if _sdk is related
Lets do it in the standard c:\flutter
there is no Ctrl+Shift+P → Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)
i have:
Preferences: Open Default Settings (JSON)
Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)
Preferences: Open WOrkspace Settings (JSON)

What do i choose?
so is flutter installed in the windows os as well as VS Code?
how do i install flutter in VS Code
so does this prove that the flutter install is successful?
Test-Path C:\flutter\bin\flutter.bat
true
PS C:\flutter> flutter --version
